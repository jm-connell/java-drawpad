# Overview

This project is a simple drawing application written in Java using the Swing GUI framework. The program allows the user to choose between several brush sizes, as well as select brush color.

I wrote this program as a way to learn about Java, with a focus on object, classes, and methods.

# Development Environment
This project was developed using IntelliJ IDEA. The GUI was built entirely using Swing, with some use of the Graphics2D class to control the brush sizes.
